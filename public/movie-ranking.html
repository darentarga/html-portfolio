<h3>FullMetal Alchemist</h3>
<p>this is the peak of anime I recommend you give this a try</p>

<h3>Frieren</h3>
<p>if you like fantasy but also chill and also a slight drama</p>

<h3>Aldnoah Zero</h3>
<p>I like this anime because of its theme like sci-fi and also maybe realistic battle strategies</p>
